# Introduction

The use of technology in the automotive industry has revolutionized the way we drive, providing drivers with new tools and insights to make their journeys safer, more efficient, and more enjoyable. The DriveScore TripBook project takes this to the next level, by combining two innovative approaches to automotive software engineering: digital trip books and driving score assessments.

The digital trip book component of this project allows drivers to keep track of their driving history, including information about the routes they have taken, the distances they have traveled, and the driving scores they have received. This information can be used to identify patterns and trends in their driving behavior, and to make data-driven decisions about how to improve their driving style and reduce their carbon footprint.

The driving score component provides drivers with real-time feedback and recommendations on how to improve their driving style, based on the data collected by a Controller Area Network (CAN) Bus data recorder and analyzed using Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML) techniques. This innovative approach helps drivers to optimize their driving efficiency, increase road safety, and reduce their carbon footprint.

By combining these two approaches, the DriveScore TripBook project provides drivers with a comprehensive and data-driven view of their driving behavior, allowing them to make informed decisions about how to improve their driving style and enhance their overall driving experience.

# Background Information

The development of the automotive industry has been marked by several major milestones and technological innovations over the past century. One of the most significant of these was the advent of the Controller Area Network (CAN) Bus, which was first introduced in the 1980s as a way of connecting multiple electronic systems within a vehicle and enabling them to communicate with each other.

Since then, the CAN Bus has become a standard feature in modern vehicles, and it has paved the way for the development of a wide range of innovative automotive software systems, including digital trip books and driving score assessments.

The digital trip book concept has its roots in the early days of the automotive industry, when drivers used paper maps and logbooks to keep track of their driving history. Today, with the advent of digital technologies, digital trip books have become much more sophisticated, allowing drivers to store and analyze vast amounts of data about their driving behavior, and to make informed decisions about how to improve their driving style.

Driving score assessments, on the other hand, are a relatively recent innovation in the automotive software industry. These systems use data collected by CAN Bus data recorders and analyzed using AI/ML techniques to provide drivers with real-time feedback and recommendations on how to improve their driving style.

By combining these two approaches, the DriveScore TripBook project provides drivers with a comprehensive and data-driven view of their driving behavior, allowing them to make informed decisions about how to improve their driving style and reduce their carbon footprint. This represents a major step forward in the evolution of the automotive industry, as it brings together cutting-edge technologies like AI/ML, CAN Bus data recording, and digital trip books to create a more sustainable and safer driving experience.

The integration of these technologies has been made possible by the rapid advances in the field of IoT (Internet of Things) and V2I (Vehicle to Infrastructure) communications. These technologies allow vehicles to communicate with each other and with the surrounding infrastructure, providing drivers with real-time information about road conditions, traffic patterns, and other important factors that can affect their driving experience.

Overall, the DriveScore TripBook project is a testament to the power of innovation and collaboration in the automotive software industry. By bringing together leading experts in the fields of AI/ML, CAN Bus data recording, and digital trip books, it provides a glimpse into the future of sustainable and safe driving.

# System Architecture

The DriveScore TripBook project can be divided into three main components: data collection, data analysis, and user interface. The following is a high-level overview of the system architecture:

1. Data Collection: A CAN Bus data recorder is installed in the vehicle to collect data in real-time. This data includes information such as vehicle speed, acceleration, braking, and gear changes. The data is then transmitted via IoT/V2I communications to a central data storage system.
2. Data Analysis: The data collected by the CAN Bus data recorder is processed and analyzed using AI/ML algorithms. These algorithms calculate the driving score for each trip, taking into account factors such as speed, acceleration, and fuel consumption. The driving score is then stored in the central data storage system, along with the digital trip book data.
3. User Interface: The user interface provides drivers with access to their driving history and score, as well as real-time feedback and recommendations on how to improve their driving style. The user interface can be accessed via a web browser, a mobile app, or an in-car infotainment system, depending on the driver's preferences.
4. Central Data Storage: A secure and reliable data storage system is used to store the data collected by the CAN Bus data recorder, the driving score and digital trip book data, and any other relevant information. This system is designed to be scalable and flexible, to accommodate the growing data needs of the DriveScore TripBook project.

The DriveScore TripBook project can be implemented as a standalone system or integrated into existing automotive systems, such as vehicle telemetry systems or in-car infotainment systems. The system architecture is designed to be flexible and modular, allowing for easy integration with other systems and devices as needed.
